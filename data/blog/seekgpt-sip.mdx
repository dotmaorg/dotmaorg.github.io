## 1. Introduction

The SeekGPT Improvement Proposals (SIP) process is a mechanism for proposing and discussing new features, enhancements, and changes to the SeekGPT models. It aims to foster community-driven innovation and ensure that SeekGPT evolves in a transparent and collaborative manner.

## 2. Purpose


* To provide a structured platform for proposing new ideas and improvements to SeekGPT.
* To allow researchers to plan out, and develop new features, that can then be turned into a SRC.
* To ensure that all proposals are thoroughly evaluated and considered.
* To promote community engagement and collaboration in the development of SeekGPT.
* To maintain a record of proposed improvements and their status.

## 3. Scope

The SIP process is applicable to proposals that:



* Introduce new features or functionalities to SeekGPT models.
* Improve the performance, efficiency, or usability of SeekGPT.
* Address bugs or limitations in existing SeekGPT models.
* Enhance the ethical and responsible development of AI.
* Expand the multilingual capabilities of SeekGPT.
* Improve the developer experience or documentation.

## 4. SIP Process

* **Proposal Submission:**
    * Researchers or community members submit a detailed SIP document outlining their proposal, motivation, and implementation plan.
    * The SIP document should adhere to a predefined template (see Section 5).
    * Submissions are made through the SeekGPT GitHub repository or a designated online platform.
* **Students and Researchers (PhDs, Masters, Undergraduate, Diploma in (Engineering/Design/Medical/Science/Commerce/Arts)) :**
    * Contributing to code development, data curation, and research.
    * Exploring new AI techniques and applications.
    * Participating in hackathons and challenges.
    * Contributing in UI/UX design, and other design relevant task.
* **Investors and Donors:**
    * Providing financial support for hardware/software acquisition (e.g., NVIDIA GPU H100/H200).
    * Enabling access to cloud computing resources.
    * Supporting research and development initiatives.
    * Enabling dedicated management teams.
* **Pioneers and Users:**
    * Providing feedback on model performance and usability.
    * Identifying potential applications and use cases.
    * Contributing to community discussions and knowledge sharing.
    * Testing the model, and providing use case feedback.
